# NgStarter
*A custom starter setup for Angular (with an Express backend in mind).*

## Features
NgStarter has a pre-setup app-routing configuration, and is designed to proxy requests from `/api` to `localhost:3000` (an Express backend server).

### Other Perks:
* Autoprefixer is built-in; prefix your Sass CSS files automagically.
