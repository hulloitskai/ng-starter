# ng-starter
*A custom starter setup for Angular (with an Express backend in mind). Works really well with [`express-starter`](https://github.com/steven-xie/express-starter)!*

This project is formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io).

## Features
NgStarter has a pre-setup app-routing configuration, and is designed to proxy requests from `/api` to `localhost:3000` (an Express backend server).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

        git clone git@github.com:steven-xie/ng-starter.git
        
2. `yarn start` or `npm start` 

It's as easy as that.


### Other Perks:
* Autoprefixer is built-inâ€”prefix your Sass CSS files automagically.
